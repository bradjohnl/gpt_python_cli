# openai_howto_cli

A tool to send requests to OpenAI in the form of natural language and get back either CLI commands or code.

## Requirements:

See [requirements.txt]

## Configuration

- Create an env variable named OPENAI_API_KEY with your OpenAI API key.

  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  ```
  
- **Optional:**
  Configure the API call model parameters as you please in the openai.Completion.create() method call.

## How to use:

```bash
./howto.py "Loop through the ips in a file and run a specific command via SSH"

# Output:
for ip in $(cat ips.txt); do ssh user@$ip "command"; done
```

```bash
 ./howtocode.py "# Python function to play tic-tac-toe on a terminal"
 
 #Output:
 import random

## Model finetuning

If you want to finetune your model and then use it, I have started including the jsonl files that you can use to gather the correct inputs.
I will test how it will work once I have a significant amount of data to feed.

From what I've read the method call will likley change with the custom model.

## Todo:
- Parameterize API call.
- Proper arguments handling.
- Externalize text prompt.
- Test model finetuning.
